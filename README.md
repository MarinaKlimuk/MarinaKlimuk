- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarinaKlimuk
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science, Neurosciences, and Artificial intelligence. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for Data Science. Also, I'm studying C because I strongly believe that If you know how to write programs on C, nothing can scare you anymore.
- 💞️ I want to collaborate on innovative projects combining creativity and technology.
- 📫 How to reach me: mnklimuk@gmail.com
